# CodeTour Extension

## Recommendation (1–5 stars)
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️

## category
code reading

## Summary
A VS Code extension for guided code walkthroughs and note-taking. It records your reading path and helps level up your code reading workflow.

## Usage
1. Start recording: run "CodeTour: Record Tour" or click the "+" button in the CodeTour tree view at the bottom-left of the VS Code Explorer. This starts a code tour. When prompted to associate the tour with a Git branch or commit, choose None in most cases.
2. While recording, a "+" button appears to the left of line numbers. Click it to capture a step and write a note. Notes support Markdown; use fenced code blocks and Markdown formatting when you want to include code or preserve formatting.

## How it works
After recording starts, CodeTour creates a `.tour` directory at the project root. Each tour you record is saved as a separate file. For the file format, see the marketplace page: [Tour Schema](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vsls-contrib.codetour#:~:text=properly%20discover%20them.-,Tour%20Schema,-title%20(Required)).
